# Timezone Tracker

This is an older project that I wrote when I was first learning web development.

I plan to finish it eventually... smile.

Written using Next.js (but really, it's a vanilla JavaScript project wrapped
in Next.js--i.e., it lacks use of any of Next.js' features).

All data is stored locally on the browser, so be careful not to refresh your

Hosted on Vercel at: https://timezone-tracker.vercel.app/

I plan to add:

- Shareable "decks" (load/dump many cards at once, for yourself or for friends)
- Card sorting
- Authentication via Discord to save cards across devices
- Ability to edit cards
- Card groups/tags (to help with sorting)
- Keyboard shortcuts/controls
- more that I can't remember right now
